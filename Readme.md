## Apollo GraphQL Gateway 

### Description 
This module provides a GraphQL Gateway that allows the interaction with Swagger based REST APIs, by autogenerating and merging their GraphQL schemas. ðŸš€  
Through this gateway, it is possible to easily establish aggregations between the downstream REST services using GraphQL generated types, queries and mutations.

#### Pre-Requisites
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/docs/)
- [GraphQl Schema Stitching](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/features/schema-stitching/)
- [GraphQl Schema Delegation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/features/schema-delegation/)


### How this GraphQL-Gateway actually works?
1. Read and parse the Swagger specifications from all given endpoints.
2. For each Swagger specification auto-generate the GraphQL Types, Queries and Mutations; as well as auto-generate the APIs based resolvers.
3. Merge our local GraphQl definitions containing the agreggations and extensions along with the previous generated schemas.
4. Serve an Apollo GraphQl server with all agreggations. 


## Getting started

### Installation
```js
npm install --save gql-gateway
```

### Getting started

#### Basic - Serve a basic GraphQL Gateway from public services
```js
const gateway = require('gql-gateway')

const endpointsList = [
  { name: 'petstore_service', url: 'https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json' },
  { name: 'fruits_service', url: 'https://api.predic8.de/shop/swagger' }
]

gateway({ endpointsList })
  .then(server => server.listen(5000))
  .then(console.log('Service is now running at port: 5000'))
  .catch(err => console.log(err))
```

#### Advanced - Adding aggregations
```js
const gateway = require('gql-gateway')

const localSchema = `
  extend type Order {
    pet: Pet 
  } 
`

const resolvers = {
  /* 
  Query : {
     ....
  } 
  */   
  Order: {
    pet: {
      fragment: '... on Order {petId}',
      async resolve (order, args, context, info) {
        const schema = await context.resolveSchema('pet_service')

        return info.mergeInfo.delegateToSchema({
          schema,
          operation: 'query',
          fieldName: 'getPetById',
          args: { petId: order.petId },
          context,
          info
        })
      }
    }
  }
}

const config = {
  port: 5000,
  playgroundBasePath: 'gql-gateway'
}

const endpointsList = [
  { name: 'pet_service', url: 'https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json' }
]

const ApolloServerConfig = { playground: { endpoint: config.playgroundBasePath } }

gateway({ resolvers, localSchema, endpointsList, ApolloServerConfig })
  .then(server => server.listen(config.port))
  .then(console.log(`Service is now running at port: ${config.port}`))
  .catch(err => console.log(err))
```

**What just happened?**
- On `localSchema` we declare the aggregations that we would like to have by extending the original schemas (to get the original schemas, queries and mutations it is recommended to publish the service and then take a look at them before start adding aggregations). 
- On `resolvers` we declare the way how to resolve the model `Order`, for this we use graphql `delegations`, where we specify on which of the autogenerated queries or mutations we relay to obtain the `pet` property in `Order`, in this case `getPetById`.
  
> Note that on the fragment part we declare `petId` as required field to obtain the `pet` property, so `petId` is going to be injected from the `Order` to the resolver even if it haven't been requested originally.

### Techical Explanation
Below, we describe how to interact between services swagger based using agreggations(relations). In this case we use the `User` and `Product` services.

1. `User` service
```
...
paths:
    "/users":
        get:
            description: "Return an Array of existing users"
            responses:
                '200':
                    description: "successful operation"
                    schema:
                        type: array
                        items:  
                            "$ref": "#/definitions/User"
...
definitions :
    User:
        type: object
        properties:
            userId:
                type: string
            firstname:
                type: string
            lastname:
                type: string
...
```

2. `Product` service
```
...
paths:
  paths:
    '/products/{userId}':
      get:
        tags:
          - Product
        parameters:
          - name: userId
            in: path
            description: ID of the user to fetch last products
            required: true
            type: string
        summary: Return a summary of the last products
        description: Return a sumary of the user products
        responses:
          '200':
            description: successful operation
            schema:
                type: array
                items:  
                    "$ref": "#/definitions/Product"
...
definitions :
    Product:
        type: object
        properties:
            productId:
                type: string
            userId:
                type: string
            name:
                type: string
            type:
                type: string
...
```

- Once the graphql gateway read from those services json swagger endpoints, our server generates :
```graph
type Queries {
    get_products_userId(userId: String!): Products!
    get_users(): [User]!
}
```

> Now, we need to extend the GraphQL definitions to introduce our user aggregations:

- Extend `GraphQl` Types definitions:
```graph
    extend type User {
        products: Product
    }

    # You can always declare the relation in one direction
    extend type Product {
        user: User
    }
```
> This will automatically indicate to the GraphQl server that the Type `User` will have another field named products which means, the `Product` relations.

- Finally, extend `GraphQl` resolvers:
```js
User: {
    products: {
      fragment: '... on User {userId}',
      async resolve (user, args, context, info) {
        return info.mergeInfo.delegateToSchema({
          schema: userSchema,
          operation: 'query',
          fieldName: 'get_products_userId',
          args: {
            referenceUuid: user.userId
          },
          context,
          info
        })
      }
    }
  },
```

- Get user + products (Ex aggregation)

```graph
query {
  get_users {
    firstname,
    lastname,
    products {
      name,
      type
    }
  }
}
