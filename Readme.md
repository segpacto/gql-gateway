## Apollo GraphQL Gateway (made by MOPS ninjas ðŸš€)

### Description 
This repository is a GraphQL Gateway that allows the interaction with Swagger based REST APIs.
Through this gateway, it is possible to easily establish aggregations between the REST services using GraphQL generated queries and types, and serve all as part of one response.  
At the moment, it connects to the MOPS API-Gateway to extract all Swagger definitions related to MOPS REST services.

### Knowledge Base
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/docs/)
- [GraphQl Schema Stitching](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/features/schema-stitching/)
- [GraphQl Schema Delegation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/features/schema-delegation/)
- [Api-Gateway](https://gitlab.share-now.com/mops/api-gateway)


### Installation

To run this demo locally, pull down the repository and then run the following commands:

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm run start
```
> By default the Apollo Server interface is available on port `localhost:5000`

### How this GraphQl-Gateway works
1 - Connects to Api-Gateway and retrieve the list of all REST services available.
2 - Retrieve from each one of the services published their Swagger Json, build GraphQl Types, Queries and Mutations, as well as auto-generate the resolvers.
3 - Merge our local GraphQl definitions with the agreggations and extensions along with the previous generated ones.
4 - Publish the GraphQl server with all agreggations. 

> `Note`: This GraphQL Gateway does not necessarily require the MOPS API-Gateway to work, we can connect arbitrary REST based APIs as well.


### MOPS Techical Explanation
Below, we describe how to interact between services using agreggations(relations). In this case we use the `Customer` and `Rental` services.

1. `Customer` service
```
...
paths:
    "/customers":
        get:
            description: "Return an Array of existing customers"
            responses:
                '200':
                    description: "successful operation"
                    schema:
                        type: array
                        items:  
                            "$ref": "#/definitions/Customer"
...
definitions :
    Customer:
        type: object
        properties:
            customerId:
                type: string
            firstname:
                type: string
            lastname:
                type: string
...
```

2. `Rental` service
```
...
paths:
  paths:
    '/rentals/{customerId}':
      get:
        tags:
          - Rental
        parameters:
          - name: customerId
            in: path
            description: ID of the customer to fetch last rentals
            required: true
            type: string
        summary: Return a summary of the last rentals
        description: Return a sumary of the customer rentals
        responses:
          '200':
            description: successful operation
            schema:
                type: array
                items:  
                    "$ref": "#/definitions/Rental"
...
definitions :
    Rental:
        type: object
        properties:
            rentalId:
                type: string
            customerId:
                type: string
            distanceUnit:
                type: string
            startLatitude:
                type: integer
            startLongitude:
                type: integer
...
```
Now, we need to extend the GraphQL definitions to introduce our customer aggregations:

- Extend `GraphQl` Types definitions:
```graph
    extend type Customer {
        rentals: Rentals
    }

    # You can always declare the relation in one direction
    extend type Rentals {
        customer: Customer
    }
```
> This will automatically indicate to the GraphQl server that the Type `Customer` will have another field named rentals which means, the `Rentals` relations.  

- Extend `GraphQl` Queries definitions:
```graph
type Queries {
    get_rentals_customerId(customerId: String!): Rentals!
    get_customers(): [Customer]!
}

```

- Finally, extend `GraphQl` resolvers:
```js
Customer: {
    rentals: {
      fragment: '... on Customer {customerId}',
      async resolve (customer, args, context, info) {
        return info.mergeInfo.delegateToSchema({
          schema: customerSchema,
          operation: 'query',
          fieldName: 'get_rentals_customerId',
          args: {
            referenceUuid: customer.customerId
          },
          context,
          info
        })
      }
    }
  },
```

### Real MOPS queries we can use ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

- Get vehicles + remarks (aggregation)

```graph
query {
  get_vehicles {
    data {
      numberPlate,
      vin,
      remarks {
        data {
          remark
        },
        totalCount
      }
    }
  }
}
```
 
- Get customer + remarks (aggregation)

```graph
mutation {
  post_customers_search(body:{}) {
    data {
    	firstName,
      lastName,
      remarks {
        data {
          remark
        }
      }
  	}
  }
}
````

- Get remark by `referenceType` and `referenceUiid`

```graph
query {
  get_remark_referenceType_referenceUuid (referenceUuid: "WME4533911K342521", referenceType: "VEHICLE") {
  	data {
      remark,
      createdDate
    },
    totalCount
  }
}
```
